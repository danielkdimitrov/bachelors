# Academic Style Writing

## How to write a research project and get to enjoy it

### Daniel Dimitrov

---

# In your proposal, focus on : 

+ Define the research question
+ State the hypothesis/es to be tested
+ State the scientific method you will use for answering the research question
+ Describe the data you will use
+ Brief overview of the related literature (focus on most influential papers initially) 

---

# Your paper should have :

+ Introduction.
+ Literature.
+ Methodology. It helps to formulate hypotheses.
+ Data description incl. summary statistics of the most important variables (show table with means, standard deviation, min, max). 
+ Empirical results. Describe results. Do they answer the hypotheses? 
+ Limitations. Discussion. Further Research.
Short conclusion.

---
# Layout 

+ Make sure Tables and References look “good”: here, simply follow published papers (as in JF or JFE).

+ Every table should have a proper caption that explains what is shown in the table. 

+ Be consistent throughout the paper (the same layout everywhere).

# Literature search 

a.	Google Scholar : https://scholar.google.com/ 
b.	Scopus : https://www.scopus.com 
c.	Ideas : https://ideas.repec.org/ 
d.	National Bureau of Economic Research : https://www.nber.org/ 
e.	[UvA Theses Library](https://scripties.uba.uva.nl/?setlang=en)
f. [VU Thesees Library](https://www.ubvu.vu.nl/pub/index_oclc.cfm?SearchObjectId=8&lang=_nl&ordering=1&objectid=109&SearchObjectId=8&lang=_nl&ordering=1&objectid=109)
i.	Check what other students did before you. But don't copy! 

--- 
#	Reading the Literature

a.	Try not to get drowned

+	Focus on what you understand
+ 	Try to narrow down your topic and focus on it

--- 
b.	Find logical connections between the different papers – 
i.	Find structure in the literature
ii.	What did that particular paper improve on? 
iii. How does it relate to the rest of the paper you quote? 

--- 
c.	Use ground-breaking papers as your backbone
d.	Use the “Cited by” option (see point (3)) to get more recent additions citing that paper
e.	Check for some new directions
i.	Quoting working papers (rather than published ones) is ok, but don’t overdo it and use them “with a pinch of sault”: results have not been peer reviewed. 

--- 
f.	Don’t quote a paper that you don’t understand at all or haven’t  read 
g.	Check journal quality : http://eigenfactor.org/projects/journalRank/journalsearch.php 

---- 

# 	Plagiarism is a no-go

+ Intentional plagiarism : no-no-no! 
    + Don’t even think about copying from another bachelor thesis from somewhere else. 
    +  Don’t even think about copy-pasting from an existing paper

+ Unintentional plagiarism : write out concepts in your own words. 
    +	Don’t copy-paste from papers with slight re-phrasing – most likely will be immediately evident you didn’t write it, and will show up as plagiarism 
+	If you want to quote exactly from a paper (which is rarely a good idea), use quotation marks

# 	Data search 

a.	Yahoo finance : https://finance.yahoo.com/ 
b.	Google finance : https://www.google.com/finance 
c.	VU Data sources: 
    + https://libguides.vu.nl/working-with-data
    + https://libguides.vu.nl/finding-data

#	Writing 

a.	Latex (check out Oveleaf) 
b.	Word

--- 

# 	Programming:

a. Tools 
    + Python – Spyder, Jupyther Notebook,…
    + MatLab 
    + Excel 
    + Stata

b.	Something else (R, Julia, C++, …) 

c.	Code has to be made available in the end. Try to process everything within your script from data loading to generating results and charts for the paper  

d.	Quality of coding is not graded on its own – only quality of the results – so, don’t spend too much time trying to make your code perfect – You don’t need the perfect hammer to punch a nail.

#	Academic writing 

a.	Dry but explanatory – don’t only quote down numbers – explain, discuss 
b.	Informative 
c.	No personal views
d.	Any claim needs to be justified by data or by outside source
e. Make a distinction between opinion pieces and scientific arguments
f. Avoid journalistic style of writing

# Hints 

+ Narrow down a topic, and stay focused

+ Keep in mind you're not writing a textbook

+ Stay with a topic/hypothesis and use methods that you can work with within the timeframe of the thesis 

+ You have be scientific. State a hypothesis. At least do a linear regression

+ Pace yourself, don't procrastinate till the deadline
